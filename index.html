        <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks?</p>
        <p id="web-security-answer" > Keeping a website secure without having help from the professionals might be challenging. The majority of the cyber attacks are not to obtain data or hack a website. Instead there is a huge risk that the server might be used to set up a temporary web server to serve illegal documents.
            <br>How would we advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks?  Lucikly there tons of  security mesures to secure a website from the people with bad intention.
            <br>First of all, the client must be told to to keep his/her website’s platform and software updated.Attackers are quick finding vulnerabilities if a website is using old version of the platform.
            <br>The next step must be to tell the client to protect the website by using strong passwords which are mix of special characters, numbers, and letters. Otherwise, the client should know that his or her credentials might be stolen easily with a bruteforce attack.
            <br>We must make it sure that the client is aware of phishing attacks or social engineering attacks. These attacks might help cyber criminals to obtain clients credentials by faking a website which is similar to big brands like Facebook, Google etc.  Clicking on the unsecure links might cause client to reveal its credentials to the atatckers.
            <br>Finally, the client must be careful with the uploads. If the client let website´s users to create and account an login, they will also have possiblity to upload files.The files which are being uploaded must be filtered. </p>
